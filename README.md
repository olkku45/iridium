# iridium
A programming language, focusing on modular, procedural and explicit design.

## Goals

I'm trying to make Iridium to learn and be a better programmer, but I also want
Iridium to be a usable language. My current goals for 
this project are:

### Short-term

- working if-else statements

- while loops

- turing completeness (able to run turcompl.ird)

- types

- a well-formed, long-term vision for the design

### Long-term

- for loops

- user-defined functions

- user-defined data structures

- working import-system

- a complete core language

- working on the standard library

- LSP and editor integration

... and all other kinds of stuff that are necessary.
